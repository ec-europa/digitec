Adrian is the Deputy of the Interoperability unit (DIGIT.D2) at DG Informatics of the European Commission. The unit is dealing with actions that can improve the interoperability across national borders, across policies and at all levels, i.e. when legislation is prepared or evaluated, when organisational structures and processes are defined or redesigned, when data is managed and when IT systems are developed. This is mostly achieved through the ISA2 Programme (https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/home_en). The unit is part of the Digital Services directorate of DIGIT, working a lot with EU Member States on eGovernment and adoption of novel technologies in public administrations.
