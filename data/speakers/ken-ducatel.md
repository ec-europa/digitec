After joining DIGIT as Chief Security Information Officer, Ken Ducatel was appointed Director of the newly formed IT Security Directorate. He has been leading the Commission's policy and research actions on Software and Services and Cloud Computing in DG CNECT since July 2012. Previous to that, his unit was responsible for delivering the European Commission's Cloud Strategy adopted in September 2012.

Ken's earlier Commission roles include heading up the Digital Agenda for Europe Unit from 2009 to 2012, four years in the cabinet of Commissioner Reding from 2004 to 2008, Head of Sector for eEurope in 2003 and leader of the Joint Research Centre's Futures Project in Seville from 2001 to 2003.

He was a member of the Faculty of Manchester University for Science Policy for more than 10 years where he taught Information and Science Policy. Ken has a PhD from Bristol University, an MSc from Cranfield University and a BA from Lancaster University.

Ken is a keen climber, walker and mountain biker, although being Brussels based means that in practice a lot of his exercise takes place in early morning indoor spinning classes. He also enjoys music and film with subscriptions to the Bozar and the UGC.
