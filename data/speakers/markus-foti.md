Markus Foti started at DGT as a translator almost 20 years ago. After thirteen years at the coalface, he moved to the machine translation team, initially as a liaison between translators and the technical teams.



He is now in charge of eTranslation, the machine translation project at DGT and is very keen to provide a tool that can help EU officials and translators deal with the ever increasing pressure they are under in our fast-moving world.
