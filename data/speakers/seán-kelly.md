In the European Parliament, Se치n sits on the Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) Committee, the International Trade Committee and the Fisheries Committee. He is also a member of the European Parliament Delegations for relations with the United States, the countries of Southeast Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Iran.



In his first year in the European Parliament, Mr Kelly authored 3 reports on the International Fund for Ireland, the Future of Transport and the European Year of Volunteering. He has since contributed to reports on the Future of Agriculture, the Innovation Union, the European Dimension on Sport, Combating Early School Leaving and Unlocking the Potential of Cultural and Creative Industries, amongst others.

In 2015, he led discussions as a rapporteur ahead of the Paris Climate Agreement and represented the European Parliament at the COP21 at which the historic global agreement was finalised. Following this, he worked on a New Deal for Energy Consumers, finding ways to lower energy prices and advocating for a well-functioning, competitive and sustainable energy system. In 2017, he was appointed EPP shadow rapporteur for the recast of the Renewable Energy Directive, and also for the Committee opinion on the Effort Sharing Regulation for 2030.
