Léonie began using the internet in 1993, turned it into a career in 1997, and (despite losing her eyesight along the way), she’s been enjoying herself thoroughly ever since.

Léonie is Director of Developer Communications at The Paciello Group (TPG), and a member of the W3C Advisory Board. She is also co-chair of the W3C Web Platform Working Group, where she is responsible for many specifications including IndexedDB, Push API, Pointer Lock API, Gamepad API, ARIA in HTML, and the HTML Accessibility API Mapppings (AAM).

Léonie contributes to projects like the Inclusive Design Principles, and co-organises the Inclusive Design 24 #ID24 conference with friends from TPG. She is a mentor for young people learning programming with Microsoft’s Project Torino, and was technical editor for Laura Kalbag’s book Accessibility For Everyone.

Léonie is often found at conferences, talking about web standards, accessibility mechanics, and pushing the boundaries of inclusive design (with existing technologies like SVG, HTML, ARIA, and JavaScript, as well as new technologies like AI and WebVR). She has also written about these things for Smashing magazine, SitePoint.com, and Net magazine, as well as on her own site Tink.UK.

In her spare time, Léonie likes reading, cooking, drinking tequila, and dancing (although not necessarily in that order)!
