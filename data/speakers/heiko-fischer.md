Management Guru Gary Hamel calls Heiko the Tony Stark of HR. Why? Heiko is a Maverick Game-changer who implemented design-thinking, agile, and networked peer-to-peer work methods back when it was just called "making kick-ass video games".

3rd generation HR, Heiko grew up in multi-cultural Geneva, but really had two homes. The second being HP and its extra-ordinary leadership philosophy. Graduating from the International School, Heiko earned his BA in Communications at USC in Los Angeles, Paris and Cairo. While making his bones in management at HP, Bayer, General Motors and eBay, he completed his Masters in Organisational Change at Ashridge University in London. In 2008 he became Global Head of HR at Crytek, one of the world's hottest video games companies. There Heiko and his team fused the 1st principles of networked organisations like SEMCO, valve and Morningstar with bleeding edge gaming technology - designing the technology to scale a self-organising network of entrepreneurs. The result? No HR. No Managers. The genesis of the RH-Way.

2011 Heiko founded the Technology Company Resourceful Humans together with Angela Maus. RH spear-headed the New Work movement, rolling-in network leadership at industry leaders like T-mobile, Accenture and Erste Bank, winning RH numerous innovation awards. In 2018 RH formally announced the development of its proprietary AI character AImee, as well as forming aRHat Games with Captain David Marquet to create unique network leadership experiences in VR.

Heiko has 5 wonderful children, suffers with the Eintracht Frankfurt Football club, loves Motor-Racing, writing and getting coffee with unique leaders in his show "Leaders in cars getting coffee".
