Sensing and control networks have been subject to a growing number of attacks that put the safety of critical applications at risk. In the automotive domain, this results in millions of vehicles being recalled.

In other fields such as the power grid, public transportation or in medical networks, the consequences of such attacks can be life-threatening to the population at large. Yet, most of our societies'critical infrastructure shows limited resilience to cyber attacks and a thorough understanding of threats and attackers needs to be developed.

At imec-DistriNet/KU Leuven we have developed a range of scaleable security solutions that promises cross-platform mitigations and strong security guarantees for distributed control networks. We will present some of these solutions with a focus on automotive and IoT security.
