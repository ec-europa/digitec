The vision of the Directorate-General for Informatics (DIGIT) is to lead the digital transformation within the Commission so that it can deliver EU policy better, more efficiently and more productively and fully seize the opportunities offered by new technologies. In order to reach its vision while also contributing to the Commission's high-level political priorities, DIGIT has set itself a challenging Strategic Plan for the period 2016-2020.

We invite you to visit the dedicated stand at DIGITEC to get a glimpse of our strategic priorities and the ambitious objectives DIGIT aims to deliver over the next few years.
