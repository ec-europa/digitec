The Council's 'Newsroom' hosts broadcast quality videos and photos of all important events of the Council. These multi-media are made available for streaming or download free of copyright (a.o. for re-use by journalists).

This service was migrated recently to the Azure cloud (via the inter-institutional Cloud-1 contract) and exploits cloud components (Content Delivery Network, Azure functions) to improve the user and editorial experience.

The web site was also re-engineered to include the latest technologies in the web domain (Angular, Bootstrap4).
