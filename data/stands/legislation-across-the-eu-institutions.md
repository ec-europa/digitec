While undergoing a digital transformation, European Institutions have kept the following guiding principles: effectiveness, efficiency and transparency. As a result, a set of common services are being delivered, taking full advantage of the existing technological advance.



_Inter-institutional Register of Delegated Acts (RegDel)_: Delegated acts are prepared by the Commission with the help of Member State experts. Important draft delegated acts are published for a 4-week public feedback period. Once a delegated act is adopted, it is transmitted to the European Parliament and the Council for scrutiny. If none of the legislators has objections, the act is published in the Official Journal and can enter into force. The Register provides an integrated view of all the steps in the lifecycle of delegated acts, thereby increasing the transparency of the process.



_Trilogue Table Editor_: Trilogue Negotiations are an informal process allowing EU co-legislators to exchange and align their positions in order to speed up the outcome of the legislative procedure. This process is reflected in a Trilogue Table – a document that represent the positions of each of the three co-legislators and the compromise reached. The Trilogue Table Editor is a collaborative tool to draft, exchange, store, and render the structured content of the Trilogue Tables. The editor is used by the administration of the Parliament and Council to keep the process moving and support the activities of each of the political sides. 



_EdIT_: an European Commission service, tailored for EU legal drafting, which offers a single online workspace for all contributors, allowing simultaneous collaboration on one draft and better sharing of legal acts with other institutions. The service offers central storage of all versions with access rights, instant comparisons between successive versions, simultaneous collaboration for multiple users and easier consolidation of comments. The service has been developed based on the results of 2016.38 Legislation Interoperability Tools – LegIT ISA2 Action, to which it has provided invaluable feedback in return.



 _e-Parliament Programme_: Aimed at providing enhanced legislative and parliamentary services to MEPs and the administration through state-of-the-art ICT solutions, the e-Parliament programme establishes an exclusively xml-based legislative text production chain where documents are drafted, amended, verified, translated and digitally signed without the need for formatting or for conversion between various formats, thus improving quality, automation and reuse while decreasing the error margin. The programme has been running since 2008 and encompasses a wide range of projects (more than 20 to date). Some of these projects bring the work of various institutions closer together providing a common tool to cater for shared needs as is exemplified in the Trilogue Table Editor; while others are more focused on the European Parliament’s specific requirements, like the authoring tool AT4LEX, AT4AM or Cat4TRAD. These applications produce documents using the XML based LegalDocML open OASIS standard (Akoma Ntoso v3), and they all integrate seamlessly in the legislative text production chain.
