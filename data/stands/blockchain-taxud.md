Blockchain is a relatively recent and promising technology. It comes with a key set of transformational elements: It provides trust, data integrity and data synchronisation without the need for a trusted intermediary.



DG TAXUD has been experimenting with Blockchain technology in the last couple of years. We believe that it has the potential to bring benefits to customs and taxation systems. A key game changer is that the technology allows moving from information exchange to information sharing. This apparently simple change has the potential to simplify business processes and the information systems that support them.



If you drop by, you will be able to learn about the two proofs of concept that TAXUD did, the results of which were very encouraging. You will also get information on our pilot project involving several Member States administrations. Finally yet importantly, we can tell you about our intended next steps, in collaboration with colleagues from JRC, DIGIT and CONNECT.
