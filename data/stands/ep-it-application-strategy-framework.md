Make an informed decision today on how the IT Landscape will be shaped in 2023: this is the purpose of the 9th strategic programme of DG ITEC at the European Parliament (SEF ITEC 9: Strategic Execution Framework for DG ITEC).

The IT Application Strategy Framework is composed of four independently managed building blocks: EP Business Map, Application Lifecycle Management, EP Technology Clock and Application Inventory. All together they provide realistic forecast about the investment requirements for the coming years. 

The EP Business map provides a global picture of EP business activities and IT. Possible usages are "Pragmatic change management" for Project teams, "Enhanced IT investment decisions" for decisions makers, "Improved IT obsolescence" for technical experts, "Smarter working" for Subject Matter Experts, "Effective assessment of IT ideas" for Business Representatives and "Central source of knowledge" for new comers.
