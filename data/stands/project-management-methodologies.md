The European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission join forces to tell you more about how Project Management methodologies help Project Managers deliver solutions and benefits to their organisations through the effective management of project work, ensuring enhanced project effectiveness, improved stakeholders communication and collaboration, better monitoring and control of projects’ quality, risks, time, and resources.



ENGAGE is the Project Management method used at the European Parliament. It is inspired by well-established methodologies such as PM², PMM4EP, PMI, PRINCE2, but it is also tailored to meet the EP’s organisational and environmental factors. It forms the EP’s methodological framework that covers different product specific project implementation domains, from Business Process Analysis, to Software development and IT Infrastructure.



PM² is a Project Management Methodology developed and sponsored by the European Commission. It is a light and easy to implement methodology suitable for any type of project. It incorporates elements from a wide range of globally accepted best practices as well as operational experience from various EU Institutions. It also can be easily adapted to fulfil the specific needs of any organisation. Proof of this is PM2@SMART, which is the version of PM2 tailored in the Council of the European Union.
