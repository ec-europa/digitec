The IT security track of DIGITEC 2018 focuses on mobile security. Our joint inter-institutional team (European Parliament, Council of the EU and European Commission) will offer hands-on demos on a series of topics:

\- Smartphone -  a demo on protection before post-mortem actions.

\- WiFi - the usual suspect, a demo on how cyber criminals may abuse it.

\- GSM - would you give someone your data? A demo on how to impersonate a mobile phone network in order to intercept your conversation and SMS.

\- Mobile apps - update your mobile app or somebody can own it. A demo on how to use the vulnerabilities in mobile devices to hack and get control of devices, including downloading malware.
