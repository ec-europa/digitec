How to stimulate ICT innovation inside the European Parliament? The ITEC Innovation Service is the answer.

Performing permanent technology scouting, the service aims at fostering, engaging and introducing effective technological innovation with potential relevance to EP activities.

We believe in open innovation and any small or big idea will be put under our radar and may be translated into a project that will create a change. A change that will make the life of our end-users much better.
