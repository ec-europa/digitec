Delegates across the EU Member States can rely on several solutions developed by the GSC's IT department:

* **Delegates Portal **- the Delegates Portal offers delegates across the EU a single, web-based, user-friendly interface to access all documents, working papers, notes and dossiers for preparatory work and Council meetings.



* **Council App** - this mobile app, launched in the app stores in July, will serve as a meeting & navigation app for both first-time visitors to (European) Council meetings and less-frequent recurring visitors. The app allows users to retrieve basic meeting information and other practicalities (details on public transport, accreditation, etc.) on events taking place in the (European) Council buildings. Future versions will allow capturing presence in meetings, claiming travel expenses and accessing documents offline.



* **e-Agenda** - the Council's e-Agenda platform, an important step towards paperless meetings, allows collaboration between the Council & the Presidency to structure and release electronic agendas for official meetings, and the publication of intermediate and final versions of the agenda, including links to referenced documents.
