The Publications Office provides a common access and reuse point for EU law and other public information from EU institutions, such as official texts, publications and open data. Apart from delivering state-of-the-art services in the three key areas of information management (access and reuse, production, long-term preservation), the Publications Office has also established itself as a recognised inter-institutional standardisation body. It has taken a leading role in standardising metadata and formats for the exchange of information, in particular in the legal domain, and it manages a number of information management tools that are used to this end by the EU institutions, agencies and bodies, national and regional administrations in Europe, as well as national governments and private users around the world.
