[Securitymadein.lu](https://securitymadein.lu/) proposes a real-time solution through a VR simulation platform: The Room#42-VR edition

How does it work?

During several minutes, you are immersed in an office with several vulnerabilities which could be used to conduct a cyber attack or to access to sensitive data/information. 

The aim: Find a maximum of vulnerabilities in a given time! From the IT team to the communication specialists, from the management team to the employees, everyone can test the Room#42-VR edition.

This fast exercise has a simple objective:

\-           Determine the “individual” maturity and awareness in terms of cybersecurity.

The Room#42-VR edition challenges all the employees of a company/institution and is technically based on a simple concept:

\-           A dedicated environment

\-           The use of real vulnerabilities

\-           A realistic context

\-           A quick and attractive scenario

The exercise is based on three parts:

\-           A briefing to explain the exercise

\-           A simulation which is scrutinized and analyzed by experts,

\-           A detailed debriefing of the simulation

The idea of the Room #42-VR edition: Learning by doing and determine the level of cybersecurity awareness.

Who can participate?

\-           CEO

\-           Manager

\-           CISO

\-           HR

\-           IT

\-           Employees

\-           …

Don’t forget that cybersecurity is everyone’s business!
