Working since 2003 exclusively in multicultural environment, in 2013 Todor joins DG ITEC of the European Parliament where he exercises service and project management activities. He is certified in ITIL, PRINCE2 and PMP.

In 2014 Todor was appointed to manage a strategic initiative for reducing the technical debt within the IT Landscape of the European Parliament. The initiative, called IT Obsolescence management programme, streamlines the efforts for modernisation and decommissioning of selected technologies with the objective to discontinue expensive costs for maintenance. In 2016 Todor received an additional mandate to define and facilitate the establishment of a framework for governance and maturity management of IT solutions beyond the completion of the obsolescence programme. This "beyond" strategy is defined as an IT Application Strategy framework.
