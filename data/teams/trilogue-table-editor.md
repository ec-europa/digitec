Trilogue Negotiations are an informal process allowing EU co-legislators to exchange and align their positions in order to speed up the outcome of the legislative procedure. This process is reflected in a Trilogue Table – a document that represents the positions of each of the three co-legislators and the compromise reached. The Trilogue Table Editor is a collaborative tool to draft, exchange, store, and render the structured content of the Trilogue Tables. The editor is used by the administration of the Parliament and Council to keep the process moving and support the activities of each of the political sides. The editor enables the automation of a lot of work that was done manually before, while it also contributes to enhance existing best practices, enable several new content-discovery services and solve existing performance problems.

Gianluigi Alari has an extended experience in managing the delivery of complex horizontal IT solutions and large scale information systems in the public and private sectors.

After his studies and an international career in the private sector, Gianluigi started working as head of sector in the Directorate for Informatics of the European Court of Justice and later joined the Directorate-General for Innovation and Technological Support (DG ITEC) of the European Parliament, where he is team leader of PROMS, a team of Business Analysts in charge of designing complex solutions in the parliamentary domain. He manages the Trilogue Table Editor project and coordinates the inter-institutional aspects of the e-Parliament strategic Programme.

Előd Dudás has a Master of Science in engineering and management and a post-graduate diploma in information sciences. After having worked as a project manager for several PHARE Twinning Projects aiming at the correct implementation of European Single Market legislation into the Hungarian legal system, he came to Brussels as a seconded national expert and worked for the European Commission as a directive manager in charge of a legislation. He joined the General Secretariat of the Council as a civil-servant, where he first worked in the field of document management then moved on to coordinate internal and inter-institutional projects in the field of information and knowledge management. He is project manager for EDIT and the Trilogue Table Editor inter-institutional projects and currently works for SMART - Digital Services.
