Trilogue Negotiations are an informal process allowing EU co-legislators to exchange and align their positions in order to speed up the outcome of the legislative procedure. This process is reflected in a Trilogue Table – a document that represents the positions of each of the three co-legislators and the compromise reached. The Trilogue Table Editor is a collaborative tool to draft, exchange, store, and render the structured content of the Trilogue Tables. The editor is used by the administration of the Parliament and Council to keep the process moving and support the activities of each of the political sides. The editor enables the automation of a lot of work that was done manually before, while it also contributes to enhance existing best practices, enable several new content-discovery services and solve existing performance problems.



Gianluigi Alari has an extended experience in managing the delivery of complex horizontal IT solutions and large scale information systems in the public and private sectors.
