The digitalisation of the European Institutions aims to simplify and streamline processes, improve collaboration and re-use existing open source solution and best practices.

Such an example is EdiT, the European Commission's solution, being developed in collaboration with the General Secretariat of the Council, tailored for EU legal drafting. EdiT offers a single online workspace for all contributors, allowing simultaneous collaboration on one draft and better sharing of legal acts with other institutions

Our presentation will introduce the problem this service is addressing, its features and achievements.

It will be delivered by Sandro D'Orazio from European Commission. Sandro is an IT engineer who started his career as IT developer in the private sector. He joined the Commission in 2006 and has been working for DIGIT ever since. During his time with DIGIT, he had the opportunity to participate in different activities from development to architecture design of several corporate systems in the European commission, and currently project management. Within the EU Institutions, he has made a notable contribution to the set-up of electronic procurement solutions. Currently he is the Head of the Sector responsible for the solutions for the management of the decision making process like EdiT and RegDel.
