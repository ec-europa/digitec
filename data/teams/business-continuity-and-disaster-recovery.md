Business continuity ensures that organisations can overcome any incidents and disasters and resume their normal operations as soon as possible.



As IT is the backbone of modern organisation, business continuity in this field is essential, including appropriate plans to build resilience, plan recovery and ensure contingency.



In recent years the European Parliament has taken steps to strengthen this capability, also given the challenges it had to face, requiring quick and effective actions.



This presentation will explore how real life experiences, the ones that trigger disaster recovery plans, may lead to innovation and digital transformation in the field of business continuity and disaster recovery strategies at the European Parliament.



Rafael is leading the Operations & Hosting Unit of the European Parliament. He holds a master’s degree on Computer Science from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. After 6 years in the private sector in Spain (working mostly for European projects of the ESA and in the ESPRIT II research framework agreement), he decided to work directly for international organisations. Rafael has worked for Eurocontrol in Germany, the European Commission in Luxembourg and Brussels, the European Agency for Reconstruction in the Balkans and the European Parliament in Luxembourg.



In this presentation, he will be sharing his thoughts on how real life painful experiences, the ones that trigger the Disaster Recovery Plans, may lead to innovation.



Sandro Mameli is the risk and continuity coordinator in DG ITEC. He is an expert in public management and organisation and is currently detached to the Cabinet of the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance.
