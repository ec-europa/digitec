Every 6 months a different member (MS) state holds the Rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The MS holding the Presidency generally hosts local 'informal' events in their capital or other locations. The number of informal events organised during one Presidency period of 6 months varies between 200-350.



To organise and manage these informal events, each Presidency MS currently needs to invest in the interfacing of (new or existing) accreditation platforms, an event management platform and a platform for sharing with the invitees or participants documents on the informal event, agendas and other practical info. The latter platforms is what we call the 'Presidency Portal for Informal events'.



Anastasios Tsimpas is an IT manager at the General Secretariat of the Council (GSC) since 2013. In this capacity he is responsible for modernising the core systems of the GSC in areas like content and process management, identity and access management and translation management - among others.



He was previously engaged as a scientific project leader in the Joint Research Center (JRC) and as an open-source solution architect in the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). He has also extensive multinational experience in the private IT sector.



Anastasios holds a MSc from Bristol University and a BSc from Newcastle University.
