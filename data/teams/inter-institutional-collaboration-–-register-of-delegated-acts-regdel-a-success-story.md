The digital delivery model of inter-institutional projects such as the Inter-institutional Register of Delegated Acts (RegDel) is a demonstration of successful co-creation and re-use culture, principles that are frequently referred to in the Ministerial Declaration on eGovernment - the Tallinn Declaration.



Such an approach leverages the strength and capabilities existing in several European Institutions, increasing the quality, efficiency of the end result.



This presentation will be delivered by Sandro D'Orazio from European Commission and  will give an update on the latest achievements, the challenges, especially the technical ones, we faced and what is coming next. It will focus on the smooth and productive collaboration between the European Parliament, The Council of the EU and the European Commission that made RegDel possible.
