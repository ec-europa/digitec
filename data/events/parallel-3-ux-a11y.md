Do you know what digital accessibility is? It enables all people, including those with disabilities, to access electronic resources and communications. It is a legal requirement, but it is also a principle. It is specifically important for users with disabilities. But it also makes technology more usable and user-friendly for everyone. This workshop will look at important issues that affect access for people with disabilities, and cover how to identify problems before a detailed conformance / compliance review needs to find them, how to think about solving problems and how to design so the problems don't come up.
