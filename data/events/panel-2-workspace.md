Digital transformation is changing the way we work. The EU institutions are no different. But technology alone wonâ€™t do the job. What are the smart ways of working and how are staff members adapting? What is the role of change makers in the organisation? What will our workspace look like in the near future?





Take part in the discussion covering topics like:



\- innovation in the workplace: technological resources vs human resources 



\- IT solutions for the workplace of the future



\- human-centered digital workplace 



\- innovation culture and mindset



\- enterpreneurship in large organisations
