Artificial Intelligence is having a fundamental impact on our society. How we live and how we work. As a consequence, it is on everybodyâ€™s agenda, both in business and in public sector. The possibilities seem endless. But so are the challenges. AI is both incredibly cool, and unbelievably creepy.

What lessons are emerging on how to put control around AI in practice? How are we dealing with the unintended consequences so far? In his characteristic fast-paced and provocative style, Gartner Fellow Frank Buytendijk takes you through the emerging world of Artificial Intelligence and into the #DigitalSociety.
