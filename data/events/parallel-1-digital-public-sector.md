The session will cover the process through which we are building digital public services at the European Commission in compliance with the 12 interoperability principles enshrined in the European Interoperability Framework (EIF). Additionally, building digital public services calls for a process in accordance with common standards and technical specifications â€“ such as those underpinning the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Building Blocks.

With this political context as scope, we will showcase some of the digital services developed and already in use in EU countries. The first reuse case explores the data exchange and it focuses on EU Send (eTrustEX and eDelivery); and the second looks at the implementation of secure electronic identification as in accordance with the eIDAS regulation, through CEF eID from a Member State implementation perspective.

The audience will directly interact with the speakers and with each other. This interaction will happen through questions launched through SLIDO, and the answers of the audience will lead the discussions.
