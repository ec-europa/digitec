The IT departments of the European Parliament (ITEC), the Council of the EU (SMART) and the European Commission (DIGIT) have joined forces to organise the largest IT forum for the EU institutions to date. DIGITEC 2018 will bring together the IT communities of the European institutions to share best practices around new technologies in public administration and to discuss how the digital future will shape the way of working in large organisations.
